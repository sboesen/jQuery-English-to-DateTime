English To DateTime is a plugin that takes (from an input field) both relative dates or dates formatted like M/D/Y and returns a JS Date object corresponding to that date.

#Basic Examples:
Monday + 1 week -> Mon Jan 16 2012 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)
Monday + 1 day -> Tue Jan 10 2012 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)
Friday at 1 PM -> Fri Jan 06 2012 13:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)
1 PM -> Wed Jan 04 2012 13:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)

#It can take things in the following formats:

##Dates
M/D
MM/D
M/DD
MM/DD

M/D/YY
MM/D/YY

MM/DD/YY

M/D/YYYY

##Times

##Addition/Subtraction
You can also append "+ NUMBER UNIT" to anything above (or nothing at all, in which case it defaults to today at midnight (0:00:00)) and it will add that number of units (where unit is second(s), minute(s), hour(s), day(s), week(s), month(s), year(s)) to that date.
