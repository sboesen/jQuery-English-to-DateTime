Formats I care about:

DATE = [
M/D
MM/D
M/DD
MM/DD

M/D/YY
MM/D/YY
M/DD/YY
MM/DD/YY

M/D/YYYY
MM/D/YYYY
M/DD/YYYY
MM/DD/YYYY
]

DOTW = Day of the week (Wednesday etc)
TIME = [H, H:MM, HH:MM, H PM, H:MM PM, HH:MM PM]
Non-traditional:

DATE at TIME
DOTW
DOTW at TIME

TIME on DOTW
TIME on DATE

next DOTW
next DOTW at TIME
TIME on next DOTW


then ALL OF THE ABOVE in addition to a + 1 day etc



Initially I'll have functions for parsing:
DATE
DOTW
TIME

then I'll add functions to:
ADD units
SUBTRACT units
